# PROBLEM STATEMENT


This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower â€” Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica. The numeric parameters which the dataset contains are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length. In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on these parameters.The data consists of continuous numeric values which describe the dimensions of the respective features. We will be training the model based on these features.

# ABOUT IRIS DATASET

The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

- 1 means that there is a 1 to 1 relationship (a perfect correlation), and for this data set, each time a value went up in the first column, the other one went up as well.

- 0.9 is also a good relationship, and if you increase one value, the other will probably increase as well.

- -0.9 would be just as good relationship as 0.9, but if you increase one value, the other will probably go down.

- 0.2 means NOT a good relationship, meaning that if one value goes up does not mean that the other will.

- The taken dataset is balanced as equal number of records are present for all three species.
- We have four numerical columns while one is just categorical column and that is our target variable
- Strong correlation is present in btw petal length and petal width as the value of correlaton is 0.96
- Iris-setosa species is most distinguishable because it sepeartes itself from other features because of its small size.
- The Versicolor and Virginica species are usually mixed and are sometimes hard to separate, while usually Versicolor has average feature sizes and virginica has larger feature sizes.
- We do have some outliers and duplicates but we have just 150 recodrs and outliers are not putting a big impact so we are not going to wrangle them.

# 4. Label Encoder of dataset

- In machine learning, we usually deal with datasets which contains multiple labels in one or more than one columns. These labels can be in the form of words or numbers. To make the data understandable or in human readable form, the training data is often labeled in words.


- <b>Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into numeric form so as to convert it into the machine-readable form.</b>


- Machine learning algorithms can then decide in a better way on how those labels must be operated. It is an important pre-processing step for the structured dataset in supervised learning.

3.In sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler(), centering and scaling happens independently on each feature.

In logistic regression, we will do <b>feature scaling because we want accurate result of predictions.</b> Here we will only scale the independent variable because dependent variable have only 0 and 1 values.

# 8.Using different Supervised Machine Learning Models

## (b) Logistic Regression Model

- Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.

- Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.

- In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an "S" shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).

"""## (b) K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier

- K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.


- K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.


- K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.


- It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors

Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors

Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.

Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.

Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
Step-6: Our model is ready.

- The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.


- SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

The SVM algorithm helps to find the best line or decision boundary; this best boundary or region is called as a hyperplane. SVM algorithm finds the closest point of the lines from both the classes. These points are called support vectors. The distance between the vectors and the hyperplane is called as margin. And the goal of SVM is to maximize this margin. The hyperplane with maximum margin is called the optimal hyperplane.

"""## (d) K-Means Clustering

- K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.


- It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.


- It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

### How does the K-Means Algorithm Work?
The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

Step-7: The model is ready.

We don't need any dependent variable for data pre-processing step as it is a clustering problem, and we have no idea about what to determine.

"""# (e) Decision Tree Classifier

- Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.


- It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.


- It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.


- In order to build a tree, we use the CART algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm.

### How does the Decision Tree algorithm Work?

Step-2: Find the best attribute in the dataset using Attribute Selection Measure (ASM).


Step-3: Divide the S into subsets that contains possible values for the best attributes.


Step-4: Generate the decision tree node, which contains the best attribute.


Step-5: Recursively make new decision trees using the subsets of the dataset created in step -3. Continue this process until a stage is reached where you cannot further classify the nodes and called the final node as a leaf node.
